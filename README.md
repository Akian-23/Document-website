Class Project - Sak Pase Website
# Sak Pase Event Website

This project was my final assignment for a Client-Side Web Programming course. The goal was to apply everything we learned throughout the semester along with any additional knowledge we gained independently — to build a full website from scratch. We had full creative freedom in design, structure, and purpose.

## Project Overview

I designed and built a multi-page website for a cultural event called **Sak Pase**. The site includes:

- General event information
- Pages about past and upcoming events
- A merch store page
- Links to social media
- A sponsorship proposal form
- A volunteering sign-up section
- A contact form

This project focused on both content and functionality — combining clean layout design with user-friendly features.

## Development Tools

- **Visual Studio Code**: Used to write and organize all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

## Technologies & Features

- **HTML5** – Semantic, accessible structure for each page
- **CSS** – For styling, layout, and responsive design
- **JavaScript** – Used to add interactivity, including:
  - Image rollovers
  - A basic slideshow
  - Interactive forms
- **Folder-based architecture** – Each page and asset organized into subfolders (e.g. `/about`, `/images`, `/java`)

## What I Practiced

- Building a complete multi-page site from scratch
- Linking pages and assets with correct paths and structure
- Creating interactive front-end features using JavaScript
- Designing for usability and readability
- Writing clean, maintainable code in VS Code
- Understanding and applying web development best practices

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Homepage
- `/about/index.html`: About the event
- `/java/rollover.js`: JavaScript interactivity
- `/images/`: All images (PNG, JPG)
- Other folders for merch, sponsors, contact, etc.
