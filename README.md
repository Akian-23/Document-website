Class Project - Sak Pase Website
# Sak Pase Event Website

This project was my final assignment for a Client-Side Web Programming course. The goal was to apply everything we learned throughout the semester along with any additional knowledge we gained independently — to build a full website from scratch. We had full creative freedom in design, structure, and purpose.

## Project Overview

I designed and built a multi-page website for a cultural event called **Sak Pase**. The site includes:

- General event information
- Pages about past and upcoming events
- A merch store page
- Links to social media
- A sponsorship proposal form
- A volunteering sign-up section
- A contact form

This project focused on both content and functionality — combining clean layout design with user-friendly features.

## Development Tools

- **Visual Studio Code**: Used to write and organize all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

## Technologies & Features

- **HTML5** – Semantic, accessible structure for each page
- **CSS** – For styling, layout, and responsive design
- **JavaScript** – Used to add interactivity, including:
  - Image rollovers
  - A basic slideshow
  - Interactive forms
- **Folder-based architecture** – Each page and asset organized into subfolders (e.g. `/about`, `/images`, `/java`)

## What I Practiced

- Building a complete multi-page site from scratch
- Linking pages and assets with correct paths and structure
- Creating interactive front-end features using JavaScript
- Designing for usability and readability
- Writing clean, maintainable code in VS Code
- Understanding and applying web development best practices

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Homepage
- `/about/index.html`: About the event
- `/java/rollover.js`: JavaScript interactivity
- `/images/`: All images (PNG, JPG)
- Other folders for merch, sponsors, contact, etc.

Image Note

This website contains approximately 42 images used throughout various pages.
Due to GitHub’s file size and repository limits, not all media files could be uploaded.
As a result, some images, icons, or videos may not display correctly in the Live Demo.

Below are a few screenshots that capture the overall design and layout of the site to help visualize the intended experience.
Thank you for understanding!
